1. Core Idea

Resource-Oriented Connectivity (ROC) is about connecting and coordinating resources, not just processes or data streams.

Resources = CPU, GPU, memory, storage, I/O devices, sensors, etc.

Goal = make these resources discoverable, shareable, and orchestrated across a system (or even multiple systems) efficiently.

Think: networking for resources, where “packets” are units of resource access or allocation.

2. Core Abstractions

We need a few primitives like networking has sockets and packets:

Resource Node (RNode)

Represents a resource in the system.

Properties: type (CPU, GPU, Memory…), capacity, state, availability.

Resource Link (RLink)

A connection between RNodes, can be local (intra-system) or distributed (inter-system).

Can have bandwidth, latency, and permissions (who can use it).

Resource Packet (RPacket)

A unit of request or transfer for resources.

Can be a “request to use 10% CPU” or “allocate 1GB RAM for computation.”

Resource Controller (RController)

Manages discovery, allocation, and orchestration of RNodes.

Ensures fair use, scheduling, and optimization.

3. Primitive Operations

Operations we need to define, analogous to send/receive in networking:

discover(RType) – find available resources of a type.

reserve(RNode, amount) – lock a resource for a task.

release(RNode, amount) – free a resource.

connect(RNode1, RNode2) – link resources for shared tasks.

migrate(RPacket, fromNode, toNode) – move computation or data between resources.

monitor(RNode) – check usage, health, or availability.

Optional advanced ops:

aggregate(RNodes) – combine multiple resources as a virtual pool.

prioritize(RNodes, policy) – apply scheduling rules dynamically.

4. Domain

Single machine → orchestrate CPU, GPU, memory, disk, sensors.

Cluster / cloud → orchestrate nodes as “resource nodes,” optimize usage across systems.

IoT / edge devices → dynamically allocate and share resources across devices in real-time.

5. Potential Applications

AI training: dynamically allocate GPU/CPU across nodes.

Cloud computing: optimize resource usage and reduce idle capacity.

Embedded / IoT: devices share sensors and compute power efficiently.

OS-level optimization: “network of local resources” to avoid bottlenecks.

6. Why It’s New

Networking = movement of data.

Concurrency = movement of tasks in time.

ROC = movement & coordination of resources themselves.

Could become a “category” like networking, threads, storage, but focused on resources as first-class citizens.
